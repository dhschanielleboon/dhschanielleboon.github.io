<p> For anime, I think I have already finished watching most of it so now I am just waiting for new seasons to come out. I would recommend you to watch Fairy Tale or Assasination classroom if you want good animes.
<p> For manga, it's the same as anime. I have read most of it and I am currently reading manhua while waiting for new manga releases.
